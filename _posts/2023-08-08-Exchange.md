# My Exchange Experience in the Netherlands at Radboud University

## Introduction

I had the opportunity to study at the Radboud University in Nijmegen, Netherlands, for a year as part of the Erasmus program. I would like to share my experience with you. This presentation will be written in English since it is the language that I used during my stay in the Netherlands. I hope you will enjoy reading it.

## Why Radboud University?

I chose Radboud University because it is one of the best universities in the Netherlands. It is located in Nijmegen, a city known for its student life. The university offers a wide range of courses in English, which is perfect for international students. I was also attracted by the beautiful campus and the friendly atmosphere.
At Radboud University, I studied computer science and took courses in artificial intelligence, data science, and software engineering. I had the opportunity to work on interesting projects and collaborate with students from different countries. The professors were very knowledgeable and supportive, and I learned a lot during my time at the university.
Exchange students at Radboud University have access to many facilities, such as the library, sports center, and student organizations. There are also many events and activities organized for international students, which allowed me to meet new people and make friends.

During the second semester, I focused on big data and software engineering. I learned about object-oriented programming and software design, and I had the opportunity to work on a research project where I developed a software application with a team of students and managers. We learned about agile methodologies and project management, and we delivered a working prototype at the end of the semester. There is a page dedicated to this project on my website, where you can find more information about it.
I also took courses about data privacy and ethics, which were very interesting and relevant to my field of study. Overall, I had a great academic experience at Radboud University, and I learned a lot from the courses and projects I worked on.  
In the next section, I will talk about the projects I worked on during my exchange year.

### Projects

During my time at Radboud University, I worked on several projects, and I would like to highlight my favorite ones here:

#### Requirements Engineering Project

In this project, I worked with a team of students and managers to develop a software application about work out. We used figma to design the user interface. We also wrote user stories and acceptance criteria, and we used Jira to manage the project. It was a great experience to work with a team and learn about requirements engineering.

#### Research & Development Project

In this project, I worked with a team of students and researchers to develop an intelligent scheduling system for students. We created an algorithm that takes into account the preferences of students and the availability of resources to generate optimal schedules. We used Python and Django to develop the system, and we tested it with real data from the university. It was a challenging project, but we learned a lot from it.


#### Software Engineering Project

In this project, I worked with a team of students and managers to develop a software application for a cybersecurity company called Northwave. We used agile methodologies and project management tools to plan and execute the project. We also conducted user testing and feedback sessions to improve the application. It was a great experience to work on a real-world project and deliver a working product. You can find more information about this project on this page.

#### Snakes Game Project in Java

In this project, I developed a simple snakes game in Java. I used object-oriented programming principles to design the game, and I implemented features such as snake movement, food generation, and collision detection. It was a fun project to work on, and I learned a lot about game development and Java programming.

#### Big Data Project

In this project, I analyzed a large amount of web data using big data tools such as Hadoop and Spark. The data was in WARC format with a size of 700 GB. I used MapReduce and Spark to process the data and extract useful information from it. My analysis focused on Wikipedia images analysis. I implemented a pipeline with scipts in Scala to run it on the university cluster. It was a challenging project, but I learned a lot about big data technologies and data analysis.

## Social and Cultural Experience

Living in the Netherlands was a great experience. I had the opportunity to explore the country and learn about Dutch culture. I visited many cities, such as Amsterdam, Utrecht, and Rotterdam, and I enjoyed the beautiful architecture and landscapes. I also tried traditional Dutch food, such as stroopwafels, poffertjes, and haring, which were delicious. The Dutch people were very friendly and welcoming, and I made many friends during my stay. I also had the opportunity to try to learn Dutch and practice it with locals, but it was challenging because I think Dutch is a difficult language to learn. So I mostly spoke English during my time in the Netherlands and I had no problem communicating with people. I also participated in many events and activities organized for international students, such as parties, sports tournaments, and cultural exchanges. It was a great way to meet new people and make friends from all over the world. Overall, I had a great social and cultural experience in the Netherlands, and I will always cherish the memories I made during my exchange year.

# My Exchange Experience in the Netherlands at Radboud University

## Introduction

I had the opportunity to study at the Radboud University in Nijmegen, Netherlands, for a year as part of the Erasmus program. I would like to share my experience with you. This presentation will be written in English since it is the language that I used during my stay in the Netherlands. I hope you will enjoy reading it.

## Why Radboud University?

I chose Radboud University because it is one of the best universities in the Netherlands. It is located in Nijmegen, a city known for its student life. The university offers a wide range of courses in English, which is perfect for international students. I was also attracted by the beautiful campus and the friendly atmosphere.
At Radboud University, I studied computer science and took courses in artificial intelligence, data science, and software engineering. I had the opportunity to work on interesting projects and collaborate with students from different countries. The professors were very knowledgeable and supportive, and I learned a lot during my time at the university.
Exchange students at Radboud University have access to many facilities, such as the library, sports center, and student organizations. There are also many events and activities organized for international students, which allowed me to meet new people and make friends.

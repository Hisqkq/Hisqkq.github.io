# My Exchange Experience in the Netherlands at Radboud University

## Introduction

I had the opportunity to study at the Radboud University in Nijmegen, Netherlands, for a year as part of the Erasmus program. I would like to share my experience with you. This presentation will be written in English since it is the language that I used during my stay in the Netherlands. I hope you will enjoy reading it.
